## OSC1Lite
**OSC1Lite is a 12 channel uLED stimulator board with precise and independent channel waveform control (currently only trapezoidal --custom waveform coming soon)**. 

The OSC1Lite GUI software and the PCB are both open source. Assembled OSC1Lite boards can also be requested at manufacturing cost [here]([https://form.jotform.com/82275611836157](https://form.jotform.com/82275611836157)). 

OSC1Lite hardware and software is developed through the Yoon Lab at The University of Michigan, as part of the [MINT NeuroNex hub]([https://mint.engin.umich.edu/technology-platforms/#optoelectrodes](https://mint.engin.umich.edu/technology-platforms/#optoelectrodes)). Up to 2 uLED probe samples can be requested [here]([https://form.jotform.com/82275611836157](https://form.jotform.com/82275611836157)) (via material transfer agreement, a ~1 month process). Otherwise, larger quantities can be purchased from [NeuroLight Technologies](https://neurolighttech.com/), a Michigan Spinoff.
