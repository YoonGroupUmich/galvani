## OSC1Lite
**OSC1Lite is a 12 channel uLED stimulator board with precise and independent channel waveform control (currently only trapezoidal --custom waveform coming soon)**. 

Request OSC1Lite and/or 2 sample [uLED probes](http://mint.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/327/2019/08/PassiveOptoGen1Datasheet_V2.0.pdf) (at manufacturing cost) [here](https://form.jotform.com/82275611836157) (via material transfer agreement w/ University of Michigan). For the uLED probes, they can also be purchased from [NeuroLight Technologies](https://neurolighttech.com/), a Michigan Spinoff.

OSC1Lite hardware and software is developed through the Yoon Lab at The University of Michigan, as part of the [MINT NeuroNex hub]([https://mint.engin.umich.edu/technology-platforms/#optoelectrodes](https://mint.engin.umich.edu/technology-platforms/#optoelectrodes)).
